# Geospatial-Nuqui
Data project focused on the municipality of Nuqui in the Choco departmanet, Colombia. This is a town of approximately 8,000 people and the goal of this project is to measure poverty levels in the region in order to identify what actions can be taken to ameliorate the living conditions of the local population.

One proposed plan of action is to deploy biosand filters (BSF) throughout the town. But we can also answer more questions: How to provide food for Nuqui, Colombia. How to meet energy needs without draining resources from future generations? How is Nuqui changing?
